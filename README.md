# asciicube

A Minecraft Classic/ClassiCube clone written from scratch in C++, reimplemented for terminal screen.

# Build

To build **asciicube** from source, open the `asciicube.cbp` file with Code::Blocks, then go to "Build > Build" or to immidiately run asciicube after building go to "Build > Build and run".
There may be dangling precompiled object files in the `Debug` and `Release` directories, could be built for other system or architecture, so better if you go to "Build > Clean" before building
or do "Build > Rebuild".
