AsciiCube is a Minecraft Classic/ClassiCube-like game for voxel rendering.
It is a next project after Voxelint. Voxelint development has been paused
because developer gave up. Any help to Voxeling as well as AsciiCube
would be higly appreciated.

This project is independent and not affilated in any way with Mojang
or ClassiCube.

This game will most likely not support Classic Server Protocol including
Classic Protocol Extension due to its old and complicated data receiving
system. The game will be built mostly as a multiplayer game running on a
server-client network.
